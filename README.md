Computer-0.1
============

Following the course [The Nand2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php), I am trying to build a computer from NAND gates and D flip-flop.

Building the computer consists of two modules: 
 * Hack, the hardware hierarchy
 * Jack, the software hierarchy
 
### Hack
 * ~~Boolean Logic~~
 * ~~Boolean Arithmetic~~
 * ~~Sequential Logic~~
 * ~~Machine Language~~
 * ~~Computer Architecture~~
 
### Jack
 * ~~Assembler~~
 * ~~VM I: Stack Arithmetic~~
 * ~~VM II: Program Control~~
 * ~~High-Level Language~~
 * Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
 * Compiler II: Code Generation
 * Operating System
 * Postscript: More fun
